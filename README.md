## 👋 Welcome to My Portfolio


This portfolio documents my journey through **IoT Systems Development**, ranging from basic circuit logic to advanced full-stack hardware integration.

This repository serves as a compilation of laboratory activities, practical exams, and research simulations conducted during the semester. It demonstrates my progression from understanding **Digital & Analog Signals** to mastering **Serial Communication**, and finally, building **Web-Controlled IoT Architectures** using Python and FastAPI.

**To the Viewers:**
Each folder linked below contains the complete source code (`.ino`, `.py`), circuit diagrams, and detailed documentation for that specific activity.

## 💭 Key Learnings

Looking back at this semester, this coursework has bridged the gap between **software logic** and **physical reality**.

At the beginning (**Labs 1 and 2**), my challenges were purely hardware-based—understanding how to complete a circuit and how to make an LED blink. As we progressed to **Labs 3 and 4**, I learned that "smart" devices aren't just about electricity; they are about **decisions**. Implementing the fire sensor logic taught me how to compile data from multiple sources to create reliable triggers.

The **Midterm Exam** (Smart Lighting System) was a significant milestone in learning this subject. It forced me to move beyond simple "if-else" logic and implement a robust **State Machine** to handle Manual versus Automatic modes. This activity refined my skills in complex **String Parsing** and logic validation, proving that I could build a standalone system that adapts to user needs without crashing.

After midterms, come next was the **Labs 5 and 6**, where we were introduced to Python. Realizing that I could use a high-level language like Python to "talk" to a microcontroller was a major breakthrough. It shifted my perspective from "programming a chip" to "building a system."

Finally, the **Lab 7** and **Final Exam** demonstrated the true power of IoT. By connecting the Arduino to a **FastAPI server**, I realized that the physical button on my desk could theoretically control anything in the world connected to the internet. This journey from blinking a single LED to making HTTP API gave me a thorough background and foundation about the wondrous usage of Arduino.
